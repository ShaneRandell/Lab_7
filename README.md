Lab 7

This lab was an introduction to using guizero. This is the basic for all graphical user interfaces (GUI) when making apps. 

Durning this lab we went over the basics by creating a basic app, and also how to import pictures, change text,fonts etc.

The second part we used the app to display a function of a circuit controlled externially to the Raspberry Pi. This allowed us to controll the LED outside of the PI and have the results show up on the screen of the PI. 

The third part of the lab show us how to change the readings from "on" "off" to a '1' or '0' depending on what the LEd in the circuit was doing. 

This can be extermly useful while using embedded controllers becasue you have have a GUI that controls and also reads data at the same time. I think for intital designs of a project this could be very helpful, if you dont have the components needed to display information externally. This could also be very helpful if you had a big ciruit with a lot of different components and you wanted to get the multiple readings at once/ and or control multiple inputs at once.
